•	This project is an automatic document reader for visually impaired people, developed in Visual Studio. It controls the peripherals like camera, a speaker which act as an interface between the system and the user.

•	 Optical character recognition (OCR) technology is used for the identification of the printed characters using image sensing devices and computer programming. The OCR process is done using online and offline methods. It converts images of typed or printed text into machine-encoded text. These encoded texts are then converted into the audio output (Speech).

•	Visual Studio is used for the translation of printed document into data files using Tesseract library and Python programming. These data files are then computed by OpenCV library and Python programming language to get the audio output.
